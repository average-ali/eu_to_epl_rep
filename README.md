# eu_to_epl_rep
Creating an ETL pipeline to  process EU_db and obtain a dataset containing records of all premier league matches

I am currently working on this project. In the mutd_record notebook, I have analyzed Manchester United's performance over the 2008-2009 and 2010-2011 seasons.
I have used the European Soccer database publicly available on Kaggle. Because of the size limit, I couldn't upload the SQLite file here.
